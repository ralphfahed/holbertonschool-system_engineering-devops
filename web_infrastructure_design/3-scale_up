Description
This project sets up a web infrastructure with separated components and high availability:

1 load balancer cluster using HAProxy for distributing traffic and redundancy.

1 dedicated web server to handle HTTP requests.

1 dedicated application server to process business logic.

1 dedicated database server for data storage.

Why These Elements?
Load Balancer Cluster: Ensures traffic is evenly distributed and avoids single point of failure at the entry point.

Separated Servers: Improves performance, security, and scalability by isolating web, app, and database roles.

High Availability: Load balancer clustering adds fault tolerance so if one load balancer fails, the other takes over.
