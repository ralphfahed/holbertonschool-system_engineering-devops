User (browser)
    -> (requests www.foobar.com)
DNS server (resolves www.foobar.com to IP 8.8.8.8)
     -> (connects)
Single Server (IP 8.8.8.8)
	-> Nginx (Web Server)
 	-> Application Server (e.g., Node.js, PHP-FPM)
 	-> Application Files (codebase)
	-> MySQL Database

wht is a server => A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides services or resources to other computers (clients) over a network.

What is the role of the domain name =>  The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-friendly name that users type into their browsers
					It is translated by DNS into the servers IP address (8.8.8.8) so computers know where to send the requests

What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com => The www is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record or an A record pointing to the IP address of the server (In this case, it's an A record pointing to 8.8.8.8.)

What is the role of the web server => The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests.

What is the role of the application server => The application server runs backend code, processes business logic, and generates dynamic content to send back to the client.

What is the role of the database => The database (MySQL) stores, retrieves, and manages persistent data like user info, posts, products, etc.


What is the server using to communicate with the user requesting the website => The server communicates over the HTTP (or HTTPS) protocol via TCP/IP.

Issues with this infrastructure

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Only one server , if it fails, the whole website is down.

Downtime during maintenance:
Deploying new code or restarting the web server causes temporary outages.

Scalability:
This single server cant handle very high traffic; it can become overloaded.
